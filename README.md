🧠 Project Overview

This project explores changes in U.S. unemployment rates between 2019 and 2020 using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
The aim is to visualize and analyze how unemployment shifted during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the civilian non-institutional population (ages 16+).

❓ Research Question

“What is the difference between unemployment in 2019 and 2020?”

While we are conceptually aware that unemployment increased sharply in 2020, this project seeks to quantify and visualize that difference using official BLS data.

📈 Description of the Data

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects national employment and unemployment data dating back to the early 1940s.
This particular dataset lists the employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population aged 16 and over from 1953 to 2023.
It includes variables such as:

Year

Total population

Number employed

Number unemployed

Unemployment rate (percentage)

This dataset allows us to extract, compare, and visualize unemployment percentages across different years.

📊 Planned Visualization

We will use a bar graph to compare unemployment percentages between 2019 and 2020.
This method provides a clear visual distinction between the two years and effectively highlights the change caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Possible extensions include:

Comparing averages over longer time windows (e.g., 1990–2000 vs. 2000–2010)

Incorporating additional demographic filters (age, gender, education)

🔍 Inference Method

We plan to use the difference of two population proportions to estimate the change in unemployment between 2019 and 2020.
This inferential method allows us to quantify uncertainty and determine if the observed difference is statistically significant.

👥 Group Communication
